        "Maincode's mission is to build AI that does not automate human cognition, but augments it. To achieve this mission, you need to build systems that allow people to both: 1) make the most of the strengths that different AI systems offer, and 2) transparently evaluate the extent to which they should rely on AI in a given context. AI can also be improved by integrating what we know about how people learn efficiently from other agents, and how they use these agents to help make decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "A serious problem with most popular AI models is that they are often overconfident and lack any mechanism to allow users to evaluate the true confidence of the model. AI models also tend to be unable to explicitly work *with* their users to accurately calibrate the extent to which users rely on their recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most AI is also generally much less efficient than humans at learning, requiring vastly more data. Cognitive science has developed models that help us understand how people learn efficiently from other agents, and how they use these agents to make better decisions. These models can improve AI systems by allowing them to make assumptions about how data is generated, and track the mental states of the user relying on their recommendations, ensuring their reliance is well calibrated with uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "I am not an engineer — you know this, so hopefully it is no surprise when I say that my expertise is not in the most efficient or effective ways to implement these systems. But what I do understand is human cognition. Specifically, I have a deep understanding of how and why people rely on other agents, like AI, to facilitate their decision-making. What I'm going to describe here is a potential solution to a serious problem I see in modern AI systems related to helping people accurately and efficiently learn from (and with) AI agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this demo, I'll show you an application of what are called Bayesian theory of mind models. These models are powerful because they explain how, by learning *from* other agents, people are able to learn far more efficiently than even the best AI models (the amount of data an LLM is trained on is astronomically higher than what any human will see in their lifetime). I will demonstrate these models on an *inductive learning* task: a task where the agent learns from examples to infer some category or concept. For simplicity, I assume you have some basic understanding of Bayesian inference, but you can look at the introduction of [my paper](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/vyw3t_v1) for a detailed overview.\n",
        "\n",
        "The scenario I’ll demonstrate is this: imagine you’re playing a game where you guess the size and location of a rectangular area given some clues provided by someone. The AI in this scenario also has access to the same clues and uses a Bayesian model to infer the most likely rectangle, depending on how competent and helpful it believes the clue-giver (informant) is. The model can provide its recommendation, describe the uncertainty of its predictions, and help the human judge whether they are relying appropriately on both the AI’s recommendations and the informant's clues.\n",
        "\n",
        "This basic inference game can easily be scaled to a number of real-world decision-making scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Military surveillance:** A spy shares sightings of enemy equipment at a few points on a grid. The analyst must infer the enemy base location based on these clues. The scout could be reliable and helpful, or unreliable and misleading (e.g., compromised).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Power outage mapping:** An analyst tries to guess which area of a city has lost power. They receive a few addresses from someone monitoring citizen reports, and infer the whole outage area based on these few reports. The reports could be from a helpful informant deliberately choosing useful reports, or from an unreliable informant choosing reports at random.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Environmental hazard detection:** A team tries to identify a contamination zone in a forest based on sensor readings from a few locations. The analyst must infer the extent of contamination based on these readings, which may be chosen in various ways affecting inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Crime scene analysis:** A detective receives witness reports of suspicious activity at various neighborhood locations. They need to infer the crime area based on these reports. If witness reports are unreliable or spurious, the detective's inference will be affected compared to if the reports are reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "And many more. The point is that the model can be used to help people make decisions in a wide range of scenarios where they need to infer some hidden structure from a few clues, and where the trustworthiness of the informant is uncertain but can be inferred.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this demo is to offer very preliminary insight into how models developed in cognitive science to understand how *people* learn and decide efficiently and (in most cases) accurately, can be used to both make AI systems learn better, by allowing them to make assumptions about how data is generated, as well as track the mental states and behavior of the user/analyst.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Demo: Calibrated AI inference based on knowledge about an informant\n",
        "\n",
        "In this scenario, we assume have information that allows us to infer how much to trust the informant, which we can program into the model. In practice, this could be derived from the informant's track record of providing reliable data, their qualifications, conflicts of interests (or lack thereof), just to name a few.\n",

First, they show how the model can adjust its inferences based on what we tell it about the informant: in this case, how much it should trust the clues it gives.

This facilitates a vastly superior human-AI interaction, because in contexts where you have highly proficient and trustworthy informants, the model can learn much faster and more efficiently than it otherwise would.

        "This kind of system would be especially powerful over repeated interactions, where informants and models can mutually adapt. Informants could learn to calibrate their cues to be more helpful, while the model could adjust its output to ensure that the human analyst is interpreting and relying on its recommendations appropriately.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the demonstration above, informant reliability is hard-coded into the model. While this is a simplification, it reflects a common real-world constraint: in many reasoning scenarios, we cannot directly verify the ground truth after an informant provides a recommendation. In such cases, it's valuable for a model to be able to make probabilistic inferences based on prior assumptions about the informant's trustworthiness.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, a more robust system would go further. Rather than fixing informant reliability, the model could be initialized with a prior belief (e.g., assuming low reliability by default) and update this belief over time as more data becomes available. This would allow the system to dynamically adapt to the actual reliability of each informant. Crucially, this kind of learning and adaptation is a natural fit for the modeling framework used here—one that supports both principled inference and efficient learning under uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking forward, there are exciting opportunities to extend this approach beyond the demo context and apply it to real-world decision-making environments. At a company like Maincode, this framework could be developed into powerful AI tools that work in tandem with human users—helping analysts, operators, or domain experts interpret ambiguous data, weigh competing sources of information, and make high-stakes decisions with calibrated confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, a deployed version of this system could be used to support analysts in national security, medicine, finance, or policy: any domain where recommendations from diverse sources must be weighed under uncertainty. The system could track how much trust to place in different sources over time, detect when a user is becoming over- or under-confident, and provide transparent feedback to help improve human judgment. Importantly, this is not about replacing human reasoning, but about scaffolding it: using AI to support, amplify, and sharpen our cognitive capacities.\n",

Not just in building new architectures, but in exploring how those systems interact with human cognition.\n",
